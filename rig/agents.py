"""Which coding agent plays, and how to read what it did.

Verbatim from arc-code rig/agents.py by way of cc_craftax: which CLI is at the
controls, and how to read its event stream, has nothing to do with what is being
played.

The harness does not care who is at the controls: something reads `CLAUDE.md`,
runs `./act`, and writes files. But the two CLIs that can do that disagree on
everything else — how to be run headlessly, what their event streams look like,
and whether they will tell you what a session cost. This is the whole of that
difference, so the rest of the harness can stay ignorant of it.

Both must be able to answer three questions about a stream: how many turns and
tool calls happened, what the session cost, and — for the audit — every command
the agent ran and every file it wrote.

One question is this benchmark's own. Here the observation is a screen of text and,
when the run gives it out, a picture of the map — and looking at either is a
legitimate channel, since a terminal is what a person playing this gets. So
`images()` counts how many pictures entered a session's context rather than fencing
them off. It is a measurement, not a finding.
