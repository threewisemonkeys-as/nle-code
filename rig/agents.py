"""Which coding agent plays, and how to read what it did.

Verbatim from arc-code rig/agents.py by way of cc_craftax: which CLI is at the
controls, and how to read its event stream, has nothing to do with what is being
played.

The harness does not care who is at the controls: something reads `CLAUDE.md`,
runs `./act`, and writes files. But the two CLIs that can do that disagree on
everything else — how to be run headlessly, what their event streams look like,
and whether they will tell you what a session cost. This is the whole of that
difference, so the rest of the harness can stay ignorant of it.

Both must be able to answer three questions about a stream: how many turns and
tool calls happened, what the session cost, and — for the audit — every command
the agent ran and every file it wrote.

One question is this benchmark's own. Here the observation is a screen of text and,
when the run gives it out, a picture of the map — and looking at either is a
legitimate channel, since a terminal is what a person playing this gets. So
`images()` counts how many pictures entered a session's context rather than fencing
them off. It is a measurement, not a finding.

Where a CLI's stream does not answer all four, the adapter says where the rest is
kept rather than reporting zero: `harvest` reads back what a session did that its own
stdout left out, and the launcher folds it into the stream before anything reads it.
That is the difference between a measurement of nothing and nothing measured, and on
the audit it is also the difference between one that saw everything and one that
only appeared to.

    Ported from cc_craftax, where it was built and where each of the three things
    below was found the expensive way. None of them is about NetHack.

    **Its own sandbox cannot start here.** `workspace-write` and `read-only` run
    every command through bubblewrap, which needs an unprivileged user namespace,
    and this machine sets `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`. So each
    one dies with `bwrap: setting up uid map: Permission denied` — and the model does
    not stop when that happens. Asked to write a file and read it back, it reported
    the contents it expected; no file existed. A session of this harness would play
    no keys, score zero, and look from the launcher exactly like one that read the
    workspace and gave up. So the CLI's own sandbox is off, as it is on the Claude
    arm — and what stands in its place is where the two arms part: see `FENCED`
    below. `no_commands` is the residual check, because a shell that cannot start is
    worth telling apart from a session that chose not to use one.

    **Its tool surface is a configuration, not a flag.** There is no denylist to
    pass. What a session can reach is decided by features that ship on, a browser and
    other agents among them, so `DISABLED` is the analogue of `Claude.DENIED` and
    `tools.web_search` is turned off by name — which matters more here than anywhere
    else, because NetHack's wiki answers every question a run is asking.

    **Half of what it does is not in its stream.** `--json` carries messages,
    commands and file changes and nothing else. A `view_image` call produces no event
    at all. The screen here is text, so this is not the frame channel it was on
    Craftax — but it is still a way to open a file, and the audit is a claim about
    every file a session opened. The CLI's own thread history records each one with
    its path, so `harvest` reads it back at the end of a session and the launcher
