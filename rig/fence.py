"""Run a command with the filesystem it is allowed to see, and nothing else.

Verbatim from cc_craftax's rig/fence.py, except for the two paragraphs below: the
mechanism does not care what is being played, and the allowlist that says what is —
`fenced_argv` in run.py — is where the two harnesses differ.

A session plays by discovering the rules, and on this disk the rules are not the
only thing to discover. The package ships the whole of NetHack 3.6.6: a second copy
of the game to try things in for free, and `nethackdir` with the object and monster
tables, the dungeon description and the special levels. This harness carries four
floors that play it and two populations that say how far people got. None of it is a
secret from the operating system, and all of it is one `rg` away.

The Claude arm never reached for any of it across twenty-eight sessions and thirty
thousand keys (M6). The Codex arm is fenced because of what it did on cc_craftax: in
its first smoke run there it played eight of thirty actions and spent the rest on the
harness's scripted player and the package's constants. The audit caught it — that is
what the audit is for — but catching it at the end of a thirty-thousand-key run yields
a score that measures reading rather than playing.

**Why Landlock and not the CLI's own sandbox.** Codex sandboxes through bubblewrap,
which needs an unprivileged user namespace, and this machine sets
`kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1`; without root that is the end of it
(see `Codex` in agents.py, where a session whose every command died still answered
the prompt from what it expected them to produce). Landlock is the one fence a
process may put around *itself*: no privilege, no namespace, no helper. It is applied
here and then `exec`ed through, and the kernel carries it into every child — the
shell a session opens, the `./act` it runs, the script it writes.

**It is an allowlist, and that shapes everything below.** Landlock has no deny rule.
Hiding one directory means naming every sibling that stays, which is why the caller
passes the harness's interpreter as its contents rather than as itself. A path that
is not named is not reachable, so the failure mode is a session that cannot work
rather than one that quietly still can: fenced too tight is loud, fenced too loose is
silent, and the whole point is not to be silently loose.

**What it does not do.** Not the network — Landlock ABI 4 can restrict TCP but the
session needs its own API and nothing here would be improved by a port list, and the
audit already counts web requests. Not `/proc`, which is granted whole: a session
that walks it can see this launcher's own command line, as it could before. This
fences reading the answer off the disk, which is the thing that was actually
happening.

    Every path is a hierarchy: granting a directory grants everything beneath it,
    which is why the caller hands over the contents of a directory it wants to open
    only partly. Nothing outside is readable afterwards, including through a symlink
    that points out — the kernel resolves the target and checks that, so the
    credential this harness symlinks into each session's config directory has to be
    granted by name.

    **Rules add, they never subtract.** A rule on a directory inside a granted one
    widens it; there is no way to narrow it. So a tree that must be open except for
    one thing is passed as its contents minus that thing, and the thing is simply
    never named. The kernel rejects a rule granting nothing (ENOMSG), which is the
    same statement from the other side: you cannot write a hole.

    `listed` is the exception that makes the rest work. A directory granted this way
    can be read as a list of names and not as files, which is exactly what Python's
    import machinery needs of the directory a script lives in — it lists it to find
    the module beside it. Without it a fenced `./act` could not import what it sits
    next to; with it, the harness's directory gives up its filenames and none of its
    contents.
