"""Launch coding-agent sessions to play NetHack.

Adapted from cc_craftax's run.py, which took it from cc_humanrl, cc_autumn and
arc-code. One game is one long session with its own workspace: the prompt, the log
it writes, the screens it is given, and the notes it keeps. Games are independent,
so they run concurrently.

A run longer than one agent session is played by several of them: ``--stint`` says
how many keystrokes each may play, and when a stint is spent that session is over
and the launcher starts the next one from exactly where it stopped. ``--continue``
does the same thing to a launch that has already finished, rebuilding its game from
the recorded history and carrying it on under a larger ``--budget``.

Each session's stream is recorded verbatim to ``agent_stream.jsonl`` — it is both
the trace to debug from and the source of the cost figures.

Two things differ from the Craftax port:

* **A workspace can be continued after a session dies.** Craftax held its world as
  a JAX state in a process, so a crashed daemon meant starting over. NetHack is a
  pure function of two seeds and the keys pressed, so ``--replay`` (start again,
  keep the notes) and ``--continue`` (carry on from exactly here) are both real,
  and the second is the one to reach for.
* **A seed is a character as well as a dungeon.** NetHack rolls a role, a race, an
  alignment and a gender, and they differ enormously in how hard the game is. The
  matrix is several seeds for that reason before it is several seeds for variance,
  and every report records which character it was dealt.

    which names the game twice before the session has played anything. Through

    same kind of thing under different names: a prompt history, a memories store and
    a log of every session the operator has run. A session is told about its memory
    directory, so listing the parent is a short walk to a sibling project's notes;
    pointing the whole tree somewhere else removes that walk.

    Which directory, which credential file and which of two copies is the fresher are

    Mitigation and not prevention: an absolute path still reaches the real one, and

    The credential is a symlink to the operator's until a session refreshes a token,

    of the two to keep is decided by which lasts longer, and both directions of that
    have been wrong here before.

    Leaving the copy alone was wrong: it expires where the operator's does not, so a

    refreshed. Re-linking unconditionally is wrong the other way, and only shows up on
    a run long enough to need several sessions: an access token lasts about eight
    hours and nothing refreshes the operator's file while a chain is running, so from
    the second session on the copy is the *newer* of the two and relinking hands the
    next session a token that has already expired.

    So: keep whichever expires later. A chained run then sustains itself — session one
    seeds from the operator's file, refreshes when it needs to, and every session
    after inherits the refreshed copy — for as long as the refresh token lives, which

    The fence itself is rig/fence.py, ported unchanged from cc_craftax; this is the
    allowlist, and the allowlist is the whole design. What it exists to close is the
    package: `nle` ships the whole of NetHack — a second copy of the game to try
    moves in for nothing, and `nethackdir`'s object, monster and dungeon tables —
    and this harness beside it carries floors that play the game and populations that
    say how far people got. A session that reaches either is not playing what it was
    handed. The Codex arm reached for the equivalent on cc_craftax in its first smoke
    run, which is why it is fenced here before it has had the chance.

    Only the Codex arm is fenced, which is an asymmetry and is recorded as one:
    `Report.fenced` says which side of it a run was on. The Claude arm's M6 pass had
    the same reach and never used it, so fencing it now would change a result rather
    than protect one.

    Three kinds of grant, and the difference between them matters:

    * **read** — the system, the two interpreters, the CLI's own binary, the
      launch's `.bin` (the neutral names the workspace's shims are written in, F18),
      and the credential, granted by name because the copy in `home` is a symlink to
      it and Landlock checks where a symlink lands.
    * **write** — the workspace, this session's config directory, and the temporary
      directories every CLI assumes.
    * **list** — the harness's own directory and the interpreter's `site-packages`,
      whose *names* are readable and whose contents are not. Python lists the
      directory a script sits in to find the module beside it — `.bin/actuator.py`
      is a symlink, and Python resolves it before deciding what is on `sys.path` —
      so `./act` cannot run without this; with it, everything in this repository
      except the two files `./act` is made of stays shut, `tools/` among them.

    The package is closed by never being named: rules only ever widen a hierarchy,
    so `site-packages` is passed as its contents minus the entries that are the game.
    That is cheap here for the reason it was on cc_craftax — `import act` loads no
    module of the package, its imports being function-local in `nle_game.py` — and
    the fence depends on that staying true.
